A quick word definer to go
Prefferably have the program pinned to your taskbar
Upon defining the word you will recieve the output definition along with synonyms
Aswell as a text file containing your prior searches


To reset the "Lingo To Go" program:

i. Press "CTRL+C" to terminate the powershell script
ii. type "N"
iii.  type "Y" to reinitiate the script.
